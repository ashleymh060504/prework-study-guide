# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    This webpage was designed to help students completing the Prework for the Coding Bootcamp. It is meant to be used as a study guide, allowing students to view and refresh their memory on key points from the Prework material. Since many students can be overwhelmed by the material covered, this study guide is intended to help simplify the highlights of the information being taught. As a student completing the Prework myself, this repository provided the opportunity for me to learn by doing.
